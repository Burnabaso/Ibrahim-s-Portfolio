        <h4>How I see Life...</h4>
        <p>
          If I can describe myself in one word, it will be "Passionate"! I
          believe that having passion for something leads to success in it. That
          is why I spend time knowing what I like to do, and what represents me
          as Ibrahim. When I find this passion, it becomes part of who I am.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optimism in life means acknowledging life’s hardships and knowing that
          at the end of the day what counts is our efforts to resolve the issue
          despite the result. I try my best to keep a smile on my face and
          sprinkle of optimism in my life because without those two things, life
          would become a prison amidst the blessings I have in life.

        <h4>From a Mechatronics Engineer to a Full-Stack Web Developer</h4>
        <p>
          As you will read in my education page, I acquire a Bachelor of
          Engineering degree in Mechatronics Engineering. During my major
          studies I decided to minor in computer science, this decision allowed
          me to take extra courses related to the field of programming. During
          these four years I enjoyed both fields. I enjoyed the understanding of
          robotic and control systems as well as the theory of software
          engineering, object-oriented programming, and web development. After
          completing the latter course, I found a new passion. I found a glimpse
          of who Ibrahim is. I found a career path that I am willing to take,
          embracing its difficulties and enjoying its privileges. After
          graduating I took the decision to make a career shift and study full
          stack web development. It was a hard decision but the passion I had
          and discipline I built up provided me with enough drive to go through
          the journey of self-learning “Full Stack Web Development”. Some might
          say why waste four years on a field that you will not pursue a career
          in. The way I perceive it is as follows: In those four years I learned
          how to think as an engineer, as a problem solver as a critical thinker
          and grew as an interactive person within my environment. I do not
          believe in mistakes; I only believe that life is series of decisions
          that we make. Those decisions lead to experiences that shape who we
          are and will shape our future selves. I am privileged to introduce
          myself as a self-taught full stack web developer in the making, and
          hope you” enjoy my portfolio that I have built as my first project”
          during my learning path.

        I cherish the hobbies I have since they are the ones that keep me
        focused on my goals in life. The primary one is Table Tennis. I started
        playing it when I was 15 years old, and over the years I enhanced my
        game level tremendously. Other hobbies that I like are Reading, cooking,
        singing, and editing Videos.
